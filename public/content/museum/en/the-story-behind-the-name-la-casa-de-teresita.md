In the 1930s, this house was home to a small kindergarten for preschool-aged children. These photos show the entrance and its iron gate, the interior garden, and the rear steps leading down to the grounds.

As a young child, **Teresita** attended this very school. She remembered that because of its vast garden and orchard, she had always loved the place. Even at such a young age, she wished she could live in that house—a wish that eventually became a vague, distant memory of early childhood, forgotten for many years.

Many years later, **Juan** (Teresita's husband) returned from his surgical specialization in the United States. He began his professional practice and became a prominent surgeon. Wanting to invest his hard-earned savings into building a home, Juan went to see his father, Don José María Gamarra—a wealthy landowner from the Yungas who owned several properties in downtown La Paz.

Juan asked his father for a vacant lot near Plaza del Estudiante, close to El Prado. The response, however, was quite frustrating: *“I think it’s wonderful that you want to build your house on that land; I will speak with the company accountant so he can give you a very special price...”*

Since he would have to pay for the land anyway, Juan decided to look for other options that might better suit his interests. At that time, this area was quite far from the city center, bordering the "Villa de Obrajes," which was then a semi-rural area. Nevertheless, this house was for sale, and Juan—advised by his mother—opted for this property, turning down others in Miraflores and Sopocachi.

The property, once known as **“El Cometa”** (The Comet), became the property of Dr. Juan Gamarra, who years later would marry Teresita.

It wasn't Teresita who suggested buying the house; rather, it was perhaps a twist of fate. When the two married and planned their life together, Juan offered the house in San Jorge as their home. Upon seeing the place her fiancé was offering, Teresita's childhood memory, hidden for so many years, came rushing back. With great love and care, she restored the house to a new splendor. Juan and Teresita lived here until the end of their days.

The house that a little girl once sincerely desired for its garden truly became her home. Thus, the name **LA CASA DE TERESITA** takes on a deeper meaning: a hideaway in the heart of La Paz, a beautiful garden, and an atmosphere of tranquility in the middle of a congested city.

**Welcome to La Casa de Teresita!**
