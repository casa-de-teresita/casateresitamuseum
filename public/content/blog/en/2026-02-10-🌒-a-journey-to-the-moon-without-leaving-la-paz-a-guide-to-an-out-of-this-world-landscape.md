The world is watching with anticipation the upcoming launch of the **ARTEMIS II** mission. For the first time in nearly 57 years—since Apollo 11 landed in July 1969—NASA will send a crew back to lunar orbit. While the mission was originally slated for February 2026, it has been rescheduled for **March 2026** to finalize technical details. The crew, composed of Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen, carries the excitement of a new era of space exploration.

Meanwhile, in La Paz, just 10 km from the city center, lies one of the city's most iconic landscapes: **The Moon Valley (Valle de la Luna)**. This geological masterpiece of clay and sandstone has been sculpted by time, rain, and wind into a labyrinth of towers, clay stalagmites, and craters—a surreal landscape forged over thousands of years of erosion.

### 📜 A History with a Space Connection: Why the Name?

While locals originally knew the area as the *Valley of the Cacti*, everything changed in 1969. Following the historic Apollo 11 mission, the U.S. Government organized a world tour for astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins to share their experiences of that "giant leap for mankind."

During their visit to La Paz, following official protocol, Bolivian authorities took the illustrious guests for a tour of the city’s surroundings. Legend has it that **Neil Armstrong**, the first man to walk on the moon, was stunned upon arriving at this site. **"It looks exactly like what I saw up there,"** he remarked. Ever since, this clay labyrinth has been officially known as the Moon Valley.

### 📍 Location and Geography

Located in the **Mallasa** district, this natural monument is a spectacular display of nature's power:

* **Living Geology:** Rather than solid rock, the valley consists of clay and sandstone formations that create "needles" and spires that seem to defy gravity.
* **Pleasant Climate:** Sitting at **3,200 meters (10,500 ft)** above sea level—about 400 meters lower than the city center—the weather here is usually warmer, making it perfect for a relaxed hike.

### 🚶 How to Get There from Casa de Teresita?

Reaching the valley is simple, with several convenient options:

* **By Taxi/Uber:** The most direct way. The trip takes approximately 25-35 minutes from the hotel.
* **Cable Car Experience (Teleférico):** Take the **Green Line** (Estación Libertador, accessible by a 3-minute minibus ride from the house) to Irpavi Station. From there, a short taxi ride will take you to the main entrance. This route offers the best aerial views of the city.
* **Local Transport:** Direct minibuses to Mallasa occasionally pass along Av. 6 de Agosto in front of the hotel. Alternatively, you can take any minibus to **Plaza Humboldt** (available every minute) and transfer there to another heading down to Mallasa.

### 👟 Tips for Your Visit

* **Ideal Timing:** Visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon (before 5:00 PM) to avoid the midday sun and enjoy the **golden hour** light hitting the formations.
* **Trails:** The park offers two well-marked paths: a quick 15-minute loop and a full 45-minute circuit.
* **Don't Forget:** Sunscreen, a hat, and water. While the paths are stable, we recommend wearing shoes with good traction.
